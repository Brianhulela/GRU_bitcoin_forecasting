# Bitcoin Price Forecasting with GRU Networks

This project demonstrates how to build a deep learning model using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to predict future Bitcoin closing prices based on historical market data. It leverages multiple features such as open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume to improve forecast accuracy.

The repository contains a complete end-to-end workflow including data acquisition, preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization of results. This tutorial-style approach is tailored for beginners interested in time series forecasting and recurrent neural networks.

Key highlights include:

* Use of multivariate time series data for input features
* Sequence-to-sequence modeling to predict multiple future time steps
* Visualization of training data and prediction results
* Performance evaluation with common regression metrics

This work serves as a foundation for anyone looking to explore financial forecasting with deep learning techniques.
